# Librarian-assistant
It's a university project. A windowed application in the C ++ programming language. 
I wrote this program in my third year of University.
This app is not completely ready. However, all the tasks were completed and the skills gained from working on this program. 

The application assistant is a program that helps the librarian create a database of books. You can add new books or edit existing ones. Books can be saved to a file (archive) or downloaded from a file.
